```
Steps to take prior to announcing the start of the annual election
cycle are:

1. Create a folder under toc/elections/ for the year of the election, and copy
both this README.md and the voters.md files into that year's folder. Make edits
to those files as appropriate.

2. Work with CFF/LF staff to generate initial list of eligible voters, based
on the best-available automated reporting at the time. Place that list of GitHub
ID's in voters.md.

3. Establish a schedule for the election cycle, with the new TOC members being
announced as close to the term expiration date for the seats being filled as 
possible. Put those dates into the Schedule section below.

4. Be sure to confirm all of the content below is still accurate prior to
announcing an election. Edit the templates themselves for any major changes in the 
process itself.

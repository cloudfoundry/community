# Application Runtime Interfaces - AI Tooling Policy

Pursuant to [CFF
RFC0047](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/rfc/rfc-0047-ai-disclosures.md),
all _external_ contributions (code or otherwise) to Application Runtime
Interfaces (ARI) projects require reasonable disclosure of any AI/LLM tooling used in
the creation of the contribution.

The disclosure should include, at minimum, the tooling used and the magnitude
of that usage (e.g. entirely-generated, partially-generated, referenced, no AI
used, etc.). ARI Approvers and Reviewers may reject contributions with
suspected AI usage that do not contain a disclosure.

Examples of reasonable disclosure:
1. Text in the PR description
1. Text in commit messages
1. Including the AI Tool as a co-author on commits
1. or equivalent

Application Runtime Interfaces **Approvers and Reviewers are exempt** from this
policy, but are encouraged to disclose AI tooling usage for transparency and
educational purposes.

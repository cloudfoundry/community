Most community activity is organized into _working groups_.

Working groups follow the [contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines although
each of these groups may operate a little differently depending on their needs
and workflow.

When the need arises, a new working group can be created. See the
[working group processes](../mechanics/WORKING-GROUP-PROCESSES.md) for working
group proposal and creation procedures.

Additionally, all working groups should hold regular meetings, which should be
added to the
[shared CFF calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=cloudfoundry.org_oedb0ilotg5udspdlv32a5vc78@group.calendar.google.com)
WG leads should have access to be able to create and update events on this
calendar, and should invite cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org to working group
meetings.

### Calendar import

If you're using Google Calendar, the above should work. If you're using some
other system (Apple Calendar or Outlook, for example),
[here is an iCal export of the community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/cloudfoundry.org_oedb0ilotg5udspdlv32a5vc78@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics).

# Foundational Infrastructure: Working Group Charter

## Mission

Provide infrastructure automation and core capabilities shared across CF projects, including BOSH, identity management, credential management, and integrated data services.


## Goals

* Operators have a multi-cloud deployment system that can deploy Cloud Foundry onto VMs with a strong
  set of day 2 operator features.
* Provide a flexible identity/authentication and credential management system for use within BOSH and Cloud Foundry.
* Maintain a set of databases, required for the self-contained deployment and operation of BOSH and Cloud Foundry.

## Scope

* Maintain public roadmaps for BOSH, UAA, and Credhub
* Operate https://bosh.io
* Provide the community with a multi-cloud reference deployment of the BOSH Director
* Package up all infrastructure related components as BOSH releases

## Non-Goals

* Provide generic operational databases for other use-cases
* Solve non-CF related identity and credential problems.

## Roles & Technical Assets

Components from the BOSH, BOSH Backup and Restore, CredHub, MySQL, Postgres, and UAA projects.

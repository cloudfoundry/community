# Foundational Infrastructure Working Group Update

## RFC Implementation: Cloud Controller Storage CLI Integration

The working group's marquee RFC implementation advances the Cloud Controller blobstore architecture through [RFC-0043: Cloud Controller Blobstore Type: storage-cli](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/rfc/rfc-0043-cc-blobstore-storage-cli.md). [Stephan Merkel](https://github.com/stephanme) led the specification that unifies storage interfaces, enabling operators to leverage existing BOSH storage CLI tooling.

The implementation received cross-organizational support from BOSH and Cloud Controller teams through [collaborative working group restructuring](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/pull/1275) - cloudfoundry/community#1275. [Aram Price](https://github.com/aramprice) consolidated the davcli repository placement in [organizational cleanup efforts](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/pull/1286) - cloudfoundry/community#1286 that streamlined storage CLI management.

The Storage CLI area now bridges Foundational Infrastructure and App Runtime Interfaces working groups, demonstrating the strategic value of [shared technical ownership](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/pull/1292) - cloudfoundry/community#1292. This collaboration enables unified blobstore management across CF deployment architectures.

## BOSH Infrastructure Modernization and IPv6 Progress

BOSH continues to lead Cloud Foundry's infrastructure modernization with 1,166 commits across the VM deployment lifecycle. [Julian Hjortshoj](https://github.com/julian-hj) earned promotion to approver status through [extensive BOSH contributions](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/pull/1285) - cloudfoundry/community#1285, strengthening the technical leadership team.

The working group welcomed new reviewers [Ivaylo Ivanov](https://github.com/ivaylogi98) and [Ned Petrov](https://github.com/neddp) through [community onboarding initiatives](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/pull/1279) - cloudfoundry/community#1279 and [expertise expansion](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/pull/1287) - cloudfoundry/community#1287. This growing reviewer base ensures sustainable code review capacity across BOSH's extensive repository ecosystem.

IPv6 dual-stack support implementation progresses through [RFC-0038 tracking efforts](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/issues/1107), with cross-component coordination spanning BOSH Director, networking layers, and stemcell builders addressing the foundational requirements for modern network architectures.

## Identity and Authentication Strategic Advances

The UAA ecosystem delivered significant modernization milestones with Spring 6.2.8, Spring Security 6.5.1, and Spring Boot 3.5.3 upgrades in the [v78.0.0 major release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/releases/tag/v78.0.0). [Filip Hanik](https://github.com/fhanik) and [Markus Strehle](https://github.com/strehle) coordinated the Java 21 development upgrade that positions UAA for long-term maintainability.

Security enhancements addressed critical vulnerabilities through [HTTP response splitting protection](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/pull/3504) and [secure cookie enforcement](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/pull/3503). [Duane May](https://github.com/duanemay) led comprehensive dependency modernization spanning 238 commits across UAA repositories.

The CredHub ecosystem maintains robust credential management capabilities with regular security updates through the [2.9.49 CLI release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/credhub-cli/releases/tag/2.9.49) and consistent dependency management. Community adoption metrics show 561 Linux downloads and 102 ARM64 downloads for the latest CLI release.

## Database and Monitoring Infrastructure Evolution

MySQL and PostgreSQL database releases demonstrate continuous improvement with [v10.29.0 monitoring enhancements](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/mysql-monitoring-release/releases/tag/v10.29.0) and MySQL 8.4 compatibility through SHOW REPLICA STATUS migrations. [Andrew Garner](https://github.com/abg) and the database team delivered 122 commits focusing on operational reliability.

Prometheus monitoring capabilities expanded through [BOSH exporter improvements](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh_exporter) and [Firehose exporter enhancements](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/firehose_exporter), providing operators with comprehensive infrastructure observability. The Prometheus BOSH release ecosystem shows active development with 67 commits and 55 pull requests during the reporting period.

System logging infrastructure received modernization through rsyslog and event-log components, with 45 commits addressing contemporary logging requirements. [Ben Fuller](https://github.com/Benjamintf1) coordinated logging modernization efforts that improve operator experience across CF deployments.

## Community Growth and Organizational Development

The working group demonstrates healthy community growth through strategic role management initiatives. [Procedural inactive member removal](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/pull/1271) - cloudfoundry/community#1271 followed RFC-0025 guidelines while [new contributor onboarding](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/pull/1295) - cloudfoundry/community#1295 brings fresh expertise to logging and metrics areas.

Cross-organizational collaboration strengthened through shared Storage CLI ownership between Foundational Infrastructure and App Runtime Interfaces working groups. This model enables technical expertise sharing while maintaining clear accountability structures.

The period concluded with robust technical delivery across all infrastructure domains, positioning Cloud Foundry for continued enterprise adoption and community innovation.

## Summary

**tl;dr** Kubernetes-style Secrets for Cloud Foundry

This RFC proposes adding a `secret` resource to the V3 Cloud Foundry API, similar in design and purpose to the Kubernetes [Secret resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/). Cloud Foundry Secrets will store arbitrary data as encrypted fields in Cloud Controller's database or (optionally) in [CredHub](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/credhub/) and inject it into app containers via `tmpfs`-mounted files at a given path, using a mechanism similar  to [RFC 0030 - Add Support for File based Service Binding Information](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/rfc/rfc-0030-add-support-for-file-based-service-binding.md).

## Problem

Cloud Foundry currently supports app configuration via environment variables. Other application platforms, such as Kubernetes, support app configuration at runtime [via volume-mounted files](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-secrets-as-files-from-a-pod). Many apps are adopting this file-based configuration approach, since environment variables have length limits and files can be updated without having to recreate the container. This RFC proposes introducing file-based configuration to support these sorts of apps on Cloud Foundry â€” without requiring app code changes.

### What About User-Provided Services?

Why can't developers use user-provided service instances (UPSIs) and service bindings for file-based app configuration? Some apps may have file-based config that don't naturally fit into the service binding model. For example, if an app relies on a config file at a certain path, that plath may not be configurable to `$SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT`. This is especially the case for commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS).

## Proposal

Add two new resources to the V3 Cloud Foundry API: `secret` and the `secret_binding`, along with associated CRUD API endpoints.

### Why Top-Level Resources?

Why not represent secrets as sub-resources of apps like environment variables? Secrets may be shared across multiple apps. For example, a "logical app" may actually be several Cloud Foundry apps resources that need to share certain configuration, certificates, or other credentials. By scoping the `secret` at the `space` level, we can easily support this. Similarly, an app using the blue-green deployment pattern can easily share configuration between versions.

### `secret` and `secret_binding` Resources
The `secret` will be a `space`-scoped resource (similar to a `route` or a `service_instance`) that can be bound to one or more `app`s in the `space` using a `secret_binding`.

#### Example `secret` Object

```json
{
  "guid": "4f00b75b-3455-48f1-ba4a-f3b82ebad943",
  "created_at": "2020-03-10T15:49:29Z",
  "updated_at": "2020-03-10T15:49:29Z",
  "name": "my-secret",
  "type": "opaque",
  "credhub_credential_id": null,
  "relationships": {
    "space": {
      "data": {
        "guid": "5a84d315-9513-4d74-95e5-f6a5501eeef7"
      }
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "labels": {},
    "annotations": {}
  },
  "links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api.example.org/v3/service_instances/c89b3280-fe8d-4aa0-a42e-44465bb1c61c"
    },
    "space": {
      "href": "https://api.example.org/v3/spaces/5a84d315-9513-4d74-95e5-f6a5501eeef7"
    },
    "secret_bindings": {
      "href": "https://api.example.org/v3/secret_bindings?secret_guids=4f00b75b-3455-48f1-ba4a-f3b82ebad943"
    },
    "value": {
      "href": "https://api.example.org/v3/secrets/4f00b75b-3455-48f1-ba4a-f3b82ebad943/value"
    }
  }
}
```

A `secret` has a type that identifies its contents. To start we will support the `opaque` credential type (corresponds to the `json` [CredHub credential type](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/credhub/credential-types.html)) which is designed to hold arbitrary user-defined data. In the future, this can be expanded to support more semantic secret types such as those [supported by Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#secret-types) or other CredHub-supported types like `certificate`. `opaque` secrets consist of a JSON object whose keys map to files and values map to file content.

#### Example `secret_binding` Object

```json
{
  "guid": "dde5ad2a-d8f4-44dc-a56f-0452d744f1c3",
  "created_at": "2015-11-13T17:02:56Z",
  "updated_at": "2016-06-08T16:41:26Z",
  "mount_path": "/etc/my-conf/",
  "metadata": {
    "annotations": {},
    "labels": {}
  },
  "relationships": {
    "app": {
      "data": {
        "guid": "74f7c078-0934-470f-9883-4fddss5b8f13"
      }
    },
    "secret": {
      "data": {
        "guid": "4f00b75b-3455-48f1-ba4a-f3b82ebad943"
      }
    }
  },
  "links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api.example.org/v3/service_credential_bindings/dde5ad2a-d8f4-44dc-a56f-0452d744f1c3"
    },
    "secret": {
      "href": "https://api.example.org/v3/secrets/4f00b75b-3455-48f1-ba4a-f3b82ebad943"
    },
    "app": {
      "href": "https://api.example.org/v3/apps/74f7c078-0934-470f-9883-4fddss5b8f13"
    }
  }
}
```

The `mount_path` field defines the `tmpfs` directory that will contain files for the `secret`'s content. For example, consider an `opaque`-type `secret` with the following `value`:

```json
"value": {
  "application.yml" : "---\napplication:\n ...",
  "secret.txt": "my-secret"
}
```

The above `secret` would mount files named `application.yml` and `secret.txt` at the path configured in the binding.

### Creating a `secret`

To create a `secret`, users will use a new CLI command: `cf create-secret`.

```console
cf create-secret SECRET_NAME -t opaque -p <CREDENTIALS_INLINE>
```

```console
cf create-secret SECRET_NAME -t opaque -f <FILE_PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_FILE>
```

* `-t` the secret `type`, defaults to `opaque`
* `-p` reads inline/literal credentials
* `-f` reads credentials from a file

This command will ultimately create a `POST` request to `/v3/secrets`. Example `curl` invocation:

```console
curl "https://api.example.org/v3/secrets" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: bearer [token]" \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "opaque",
    "name": "my-app-secrets",
    "value": {
      "application.yml" : "---\napplication:\n ...",
      "secret.txt": "my-secret"
    }
    "metadata": {
      "annotations": {},
      "labels": {}
    },
    "relationships": {
      "space": {
        "data": {
          "guid": "7304bc3c-7010-11ea-8840-48bf6bec2d78"
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

### Updating a `secret`
Users will be able to update a `secret` using similar commands:

```console
cf update-secret SECRET_NAME SECRET_TYPE -p <CREDENTIALS_INLINE>
```

```console
cf update-secret SECRET_NAME SECRET_TYPE -f <FILE_PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_FILE>
```

Initially apps will need to be restarted to receive `secret` updates, but eventually we may be able to support updates that don't require a restart.
The "Update secret" endpoint in the CF API will take a `PATCH` request. Example `curl` invocation:

```console
curl "https://api.example.org/v3/secrets/[guid]" \
  -X PATCH \
  -H "Authorization: bearer [token]" \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "opaque",
    "value": {
      "application.yml" : "---\napplication:\n ...",
      "secret.txt": "updated-secret-value"
    }
    "metadata": {
      "annotations": {},
      "labels": {}
    }
  }'
```

### Reading a `secret` and Its Value
Users that have permission to view environment variables for an app will be able to view `secret` values within a `space`. We will introduce a separate endpoint for retrieving these (similar to how app environment variables and service instance credentials are retrieved): `GET /v3/secrets/:guid/value`.

```console
curl "https://api.example.org/v3/secrets/[guid]/value" \
  -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: bearer [token]"
  
"value" : {
  "some-json-key" : "some-json-value"
}
```

To support this, Cloud Controller will need to have both read and write permissions for the `secret`'s corresponding credential in CredHub.

### Creating a `secret_binding`
To create `secret_bindings`, users will use a new CLI command: `cf bind-secret`. This will create a `POST` request to `/v3/secret_bindings`.

```console
cf bind-secret APP_NAME SECRET_NAME MOUNT_PATH
```

### CLI Changes
Work will need to be done to implement the following commands:
- `cf create-secret`
- `cf update-secret`
- `cf bind-secret`
- `cf secrets`
- `cf secret`
- `cf delete-secret`
- `cf unbind-secret`

In addition, modifications may be made to existing CLI commands to surface `secrets` and `secret_bindings`. For example, adding bound `secret`s to `cf app` output.

### Cloud Controller Changes
New database tables will need to be created to store `secret`s and `secret_binding`s. CRUD APIs will need to be created for these resources. We will also need an API to support viewing a `secret`'s value.

### BBS changes
BBS was recently updated to support `ServiceBindingFiles` as part of RFC 0030. A `secret`'s value may result in one or more files being created in the `tmpfs` mounted directory defined by the `MountPath` parameter.

```
action := &models.RunAction{
  Path: "/path/to/executable",
  Args: []string{"some", "args to", "pass in"},
  Dir: "/path/to/working/directory",
  User: "username",
  EnvironmentVariables: []*models.EnvironmentVariable{
    {
      Name: "ENVNAME",
      Value: "ENVVALUE",
    },
  },
 ServiceBindingFiles: []*models.Files{
    {
      Name: "/etc/cf-instance-binding",
      Value: "VALUE",
    },
  },
  Secrets: []*models.Secret{
    {
      Name: "SECRET_NAME",
      MountPath: "/etc/conf/",
      Value: "credhub-credential-id:<CREDHUB_CREDENTIAL_ID>",
    },
    {
      Name: "OTHER_SECRET_NAME",
      MountPath: "/etc/conf/",
      Value: "<SECRET_CONTENT_AS_JSON>",
    },
  },
  ResourceLimits: &models.ResourceLimits{
    Nofile: 1000,
  },
  LogSource: "some-log-source",
  SuppressLogOutput: false,
}
```

### Launcher Changes?
The launcher (or something else) will need to be updated to retrieve credentials from CredHub for `Secret Bindings`. It currently already does this for CredHub references contained within `VCAP_SERVICES` using the app container's instance identity credentials. Is there something other than the launcher that should have this responsibility?

Alternatively, credentials could be fetched by Cloud Controller (it does this already for Service Keys) and passed through directly to Diego. This has the disadvantage of increasing the size of the DesiredLRP and storing storing the secret contents in Diego's database.

### Other Considerations


#### CredHub Maximum Secret Size
Kubernetes Secrets and ConfigMaps have a [maximum size of 1 MiB](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/#motivation). The [maximum size of a CredHub credential is 64Kb](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/credhub/credential-types.html). For `secrets` that are stored in CredHub, we will need to limit our Secrets to 64KB or increase the CredHub limit.

For `secrets` that are stored in Cloud Controller we could support an operator configurable limit up to 1 MiB.

#### (Future) Rotatable Secrets
If we make the `*Files` parameters on the `DesiredLRP` mutable in BBS, then Cloud Controller could update the `secret`s in the `DesiredLRP`, without requiring container recreation.

For certain CredHub credential types such as `certificate` or `password`, we may be able to expose CredHub credential rotation/[regeneration](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/credhub/version/main/#_regenerate_credentials_endpoint) functionality.

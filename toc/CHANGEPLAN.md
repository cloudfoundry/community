# Governance Evolution

## Approach

The general approach to transitioning from the existing Cloud Foundry
Foundation technical governance process to the new process is to start
with the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) and then allow that new TOC 
to work through the details of restructuring the community.

It will be critically important that existing technical community members,
and especially technical community leaders, continue their work on the
projects during the transition process. 

We believe that the community will work together with the right intentions 
during this transition period. When in doubt, community members should
refer to the newly documented [principles](./PRINCIPLES.md) to guide their
decisions.

## TOC Formation

### Governing Board Approval

The TOC structure must be approved by the Cloud Foundry Foundation
Governing Board. Once approved, the technical community can proceed
with it's reorganization, led by a newly elected TOC.

### Initial TOC Eligibility

The rules for eligibility to be a member of the TOC include specific
roles, which do not exist at the time of the first election. As such, 
eligibility to be nominated for the TOC during the first election will
be defined as:

* Community members who are PMC Leads, Project Leads or committers within 
  any PMC or project. Each member organization of the CFF can also nominate 
  one additional person not meeting these criteria as a candidate for the 
  first TOC election.
  
### Initial TOC Election Voter Eligibility

The rules for eligibility to vote in a TOC election will apply to the 
first election, but will explicitly include all community members that
are PMC Leads, Project Leads or committers within any PMC or project.

### Initial TOC Terms

The first TOC election will be structured to elect five TOC members. Using 
the results of the election, the two nominees with the highest number of 
votes will have two year terms. The next three nominees, by number of votes,
will have an initial term of one year. 

The second TOC election will be held a year after the initial election. During 
that second election cycle, the three TOC members with initial one year terms 
will be at the end of their initial terms. Those TOC seats will be up for election
during that second TOC election.

### First TOC Meeting

Once the election is complete, the newly formed TOC will meet. During that 
meeting, the following must be addressed:

1) Selection of a TOC Chair
2) Schedule for ongoing TOC meetings

Beyond that, the TOC will need to begin the process of completing the technical 
governance restructring process.

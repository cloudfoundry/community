## Working Groups

(Status: ACTIVE)

The technical community's activities are structured into working groups by the TOC. For a listing of the
active working groups, see [WORKING-GROUPS.md](toc/working-groups/WORKING-GROUPS.md).

### Working Group Activity Reports

Automated working group activity reports are generated quarterly for TOC review. These reports analyze GitHub activity across all repositories managed by each working group and provide strategic insights into development progress.

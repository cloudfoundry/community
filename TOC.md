    project.

    sequencing.

    leadership changes of working groups.

    accepting new sub-projects and pruning existing sub-projects to maintain
    community focus

    [code of conduct](./CONTRIBUTING.md#code-of-conduct) and respects our
    [values](./VALUES.md).

  - Foster an environment for a healthy and happy community of developers and
    contributors.

## Committee Mechanics

The TOC is [elected by the community](./mechanics/TOC.md).

The TOCâ€™s work includes:

- Regular committee meetings to discuss hot topics, resulting in a set of
  published
  [meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hR5ijJQjz65QkLrgEhWjv3Q86tWVxYj_9xdhQ6Y5D8Q/edit#).

- Create, review, approve and publish technical project governance documents.

- Create proposals for consideration by individual working groups to help steer
  their work towards a common project-wide objective.

- Review/address/comment on project issues.

- Act as a high-level sounding board for technical questions or designs bubbled
  up by the working groups.

## Committee Decisionmaking

The TOC will strive to make decisions based on consensus. 

In situations where discussion is unable to result in consensus, any member of the TOC may call 
a vote of the TOC to reach a decision. 

Each member of the TOC is entitled to one vote in any voting matters. A vote will pass 
by receiving a YES vote from a majority (more than 50%) of all TOC members not explicitly abstaining 
from the vote.

Because a vote indicates that consensus was not achieved, decisions requiring a vote are best handled 
on a publicly visible, asynchronus medium (ex: email or GitHub issue). Voting in an asynchronus medium 
allows TOC members time to consider the matter further and receive community input. 

Votes held in a synchronus meeting require the meeting to have achieved quorum, and for the YES 
vote count to have passed the majority criteria listed above.

Votes held during a synchronous meeting must be documented transparently, including the specific votes 
of each TOC member, after conclusion of the meeting in question. Limited exceptions to this transparency 
requirement include situaions where there is a security or privacy reason for secrecy.

## Committee Meeting

Quorum for TOC meetings requires at least 50% of TOC members to be present.

Community members are encouraged to suggest topics for discussion ahead of the
TOC meetings, and are invited to observe these meetings and engage with the TOC
during the community feedback period at the end of each meeting.

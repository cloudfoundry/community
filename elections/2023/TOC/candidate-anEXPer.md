Nomination Statement: This being a self nomination, I'll speak in the first-person. I've worked on CF for almost ten years. I was anchor of the release integration team that conceived of and developed cf-deployment, guided the design of the v6 CLI, orchestrated the transition of Pivotal Web Services from cf-release to multi-deployment/cell-block cf-deployment, and have recently resigned from VMware after years of being a Technology Lead focused on release, packaging, and upgrade related issues for TAS, VMware's commercialized distribution.

I care deeply about Cloud Foundry and related technologies like Concourse, and bring significant experience and expertise in transitions and roadmaps through eras of technological and organizational change.

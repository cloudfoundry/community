## Candidate Processes


### Nominations


Every eligible voter can nominate candidates for the Steering Committee, and we encourage you to do so. If you are 
eligible to serve on the committee, you can self-nominate. If you want to nominate someone else, do so as 
well. 


You can nominate someone for the Steering Committee by [submitting an issue using this template](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/issues/new?assignees=&labels=election&template=paketo-buildpacks-sc-candidate-nomination.md&title=Paketo+Buildpacks+Steering+Committee+Candidate+Nomination+for+%5BPerson+Name%5D). 


The deadline is June 1nd to be nominated (and for the nominee to indicate acceptance).


It is strongly recommended that you confirm that a nominee is interested and willing
to accept the nomination prior to submitting the nomination issue.


### Confirming Nominee Eligibility


Once a nomination is received, the CFF staff or existing Steering Committee will contact the nominee to confirm acceptance
of the nomination. If the nominee accepts, they will be added to the list of nominees at the bottom
of this file. The nomination issue will be closed, noting if the nominee accepted or declined the 
nomination.


## Voting Process


The 2023 Paketo Buildpacks Steering Committee election will be conducted using a [CFF-managed instance](https://elections.cloudfoundry.org) of [Elekto](https://elekto.dev), a CNCF infrastructure project
that implements Condorcet ranked-choice voting using the Schulze method. Elekto relies on GitHub
for user identity and authentication, which better matches how members interact with the Cloud
Foundry community on a day-to-day basis than the email identity that the [Condorcet Internet Voting
Service](https://civs1.civs.us/) requires.

As stated in the Paketo [Steering Committee documentation](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/community/blob/main/STEERING.md), Any individual who has contributed to Paketo Buildpacks in the twelve months prior to the election is eligible to vote in the Steering Committee election. Contributions include, but are not limited to, opening PRs, reviewing and commenting on PRs, opening and commenting on issues, writing design docs, commenting on design docs, participating in mailing list discussions and participating in working groups.

If Elekto fails to recognize you as eligible to vote in this election even though you believe you
should be, please file a voting exception request [within the Elekto app](https://elections.cloudfoundry.org/app/elections/2023---Paketo-SC/exception) or [via an issue on the
community repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/issues/new?assignees=&labels=election&template=request-to-be-elector-for-paketo-buildpacks-sc-election.md&title=Request+to+be+an+elector+for+Paketo+Steering+Committee+election).

Once the official election period starts, you will be able to rank the candidates in your preferred
order and submit your ballot. You may set a password on your ballot, which is required to change
your ballot later within the election period. Once the election period ends, all ballots are final.

All ballot data for Elekto is stored on a database managed by the CFF staff, and is not shared with
third parties. Individual ballot data is encrypted, and ballot data can be retrieved only in
aggregate form.


## Election Results


The newly elected body will be announced via cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org and main@lists.paketo.io on 20 Jun, 2022.


Following the announcement, the voting results and winners will be published.

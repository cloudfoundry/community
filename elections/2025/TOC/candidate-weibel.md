Nomination Statement: Hi! I'm a long time operator and advocate for Cloud Foundry and BOSH. I'm an active contributor in the Cloud Foundry Slack organization answering community questions and offering insights as folks need them. I've been a presenter at a few CF Summits and authored 60+ CF, BOSH and related technologies in blog postings. I hope to represent the continued excellent platform operator experience while balancing the needs of Working Groups, end users and everyone else with an interest in this technology stack.

Nomination Statement: I am presently on the Paketo Steering Committee, and I'd like to continue on helping and guiding the project. I believe I'm the right candidate as I have been both a long time user of buildpacks and a long time contributor to them. This gives me unique insights into the challenges of both users and developers. I believe I can use my experience to help steer the project to a future that's sustainable and at the same time delivers a compelling set of features to our users.

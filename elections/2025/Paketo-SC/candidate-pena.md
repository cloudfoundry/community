Nomination Statement: I am presently a paketo buildpacks maintainer for numerous buildpacks, builders, and tooling. I started out as a user, began making contributions as needed to support work at Rapid7, and have now become a maintainer to support the project. I believe I am the right candidate because I am a user of paketo buildpacks first and foremost and therefore have an understanding of the end-user and developer experience. I am also familiar with the project after working with paketo and buildpacks in general for the last 3 years. I believe I have the right experience and skills to help drive the paketo project's future, while helping to deliver on some long-term roadmap goals such multi-arch support across all paketo buildpacks.
